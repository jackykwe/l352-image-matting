# Python Re-implementation of Classical Image Matting Algorithms

Normal usage: run `python3 src/main.py --help`, there is a command-line interface that describes usage instructions.

# Developer Notes

This is the repository as part of the assessment requirement for L352 Advanced Graphics \& Image Processing.

To automatically run `src/main.py` for all algorithms and images, place dataset (e.g. from [Alpha Matting Evaluation Website](http://alphamatting.com)) at folder `datasets/` in the project directory (as a sibling to `src/`), then run `python3 src/main-iter.py`. Once done, run `python3 src/main-iter-eval.py` to generate statistics that appear in the evaluation section of the report.
